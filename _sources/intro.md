# DietGMTKN55-NOF

THIS PAGE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND THE DATA PRESENTED IS EITHER INCOMPLETE OR EVEN JUST A TEMPORARY PLACEHOLDER UNTIL THE REAL DATA IS PLACED. THIS LEGEND WILL BE REMOVED WHEN THE DATA IS READY AND CAN BE TRUSTED. 

This webpage presents the results of the DietGMTKN55 to PNOF (Piris Natural Orbital Functional) calculations. DietGMTKN55 is a reduced version of the GMTKN55 test set for fast benchmarking quantum chemistry methodologies. 

The set is formed by four subsets: 030, 050, 100 and 150, these desginating the given number of composing systems.

We currently provide results for PNOF5, PNOF7, PNOF7s, GNOF and GNOFm with perfect pairing for all sets. Results for extended pairing are provided for the subsets 030 and 050.
