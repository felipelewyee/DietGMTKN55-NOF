```{admonition} About
:class: tip
This website presents PNOF (Piris Natural Orbital Functional) results within the DietGMTKN55 benchmark, a streamlined version of the GMTKN55 designed for rapid evaluation of electronic structure methods.  The original GMTKN55 benchmark comprises 55 datasets with 1500 chemical systems (including reactions, conformational changes, etc.) and uses a numerical indicator to assess method accuracy.

The DietGMTKN55 benchmark approximates this accuracy using significantly fewer systems: 30, 50, 100, and 150.  While all DietGMTKN55 versions aim to reproduce the full GMTKN55 benchmark value, using more systems is expected to improve accuracy.

Beyond numerical results, this website provides insights into the performance of various NOFs across chemically similar systems. This allows users to understand the current NOF's strengths and weaknesses, identify areas for improvement, and leverage its capabilities for challenging chemical problems.

```{admonition} How to use this page
:class: dropdown
The results can be explored using the bar at the left of the page.

- Results are divied in two parts: i) perfect pairing and ii) extended pairing.
- Each part presents the results of the 030, 050, 100 and 150 systems. (150 for extended pairing is still in process)
- Clicking on a test (030, 050, 100 and 150) display a bar plot that summarizes the absolute deviations for all the NOFs, and a submenu is shown to examine results for each specific functional: PNOF5, PNOF7s, PNOF7, GNOF, GNOFm.
- Placing the pointer over a bar of the plot displays a description of the chemical process involved on that set.
- Each set is formed by several systems with common characteristics. The involved molecules, stechiometry, energy and errors can be explored using the molecular visualizer below the bar plot.
